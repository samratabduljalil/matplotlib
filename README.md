# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository demonstrates various types of data visualizations using Python's `matplotlib` library. The examples include scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, histograms, line plots, and 3D surface plots, with a focus on incorporating color, axis labels, titles, subtitles, and other customizations.

## Features

- **Scatter Plot**: Displays data points with custom colors, labels, and grid lines.
- **Pie Chart**: Represents categorical data distribution with customizable colors and exploded slices.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares categories with distinct colors and grid lines for better readability.
- **Histogram**: Visualizes the frequency distribution of numerical data with defined bins and edge colors.
- **Line Plot**: Shows trends over time or sequences with markers and legends.
- **3D Graph**: Creates a surface plot in three dimensions with a color map.
